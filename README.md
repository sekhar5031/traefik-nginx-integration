# Traefik and Nginx Project

## Project Overview
This project sets up a reverse proxy and web server environment using Traefik and Nginx. The primary goal is to manage and secure web traffic efficiently, leveraging Traefik's dynamic routing and automatic SSL certificate management capabilities.

## Key Components
1. **Traefik**:
   - Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
   - Automatically manages SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt and ACME protocol.
   - Configured to handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, with automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.
   - Provides a dashboard for monitoring and managing routes (optional).

2. **Nginx**:
   - Serves static content from the `website` directory.
   - Acts as a backend service behind Traefik, handling requests routed by Traefik.

## Configuration Details
- **Docker Compose**: Utilizes a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
  - Traefik service is configured with necessary command-line arguments for entry points, providers, and certificate resolvers.
  - Nginx service is set up to serve static files and is labeled for Traefik routing.

- **Networking**:
  - Ports 80 and 443 are exposed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, respectively.
  - Optional port 8080 can be used for accessing the Traefik dashboard.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure that only necessary ports are open in your security groups.
- Consider restricting access to the Traefik dashboard to trusted IPs or internal networks.

## Usage
- Deploy the stack using `docker-compose up` to start both Traefik and Nginx services.
- Access your web application via the configured domain, ensuring that traffic is routed and secured by Traefik.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more services or applications behind Traefik for load balancing.
- Implement additional middleware for security, such as rate limiting or IP whitelisting.
- Explore Traefik's advanced features like canary deployments or blue-green deployments.
